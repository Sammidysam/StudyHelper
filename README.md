===========

A program used to aid studying, programmed in C.  I originally programmed the basics in Java, but wanted to convert it to C in order to improve my knowledge of C.

To make/build/compile with no obj and bin directories existing,

<pre>
make
</pre>

The Makefile will make the necessary directories and compile the source for you.

If you have already made/built/compiled the source once and then cleaned, then you will need to type,

<pre>
make all
</pre>

To compile again.  If you prefer not to, you could delete the bin and obj directories and then type make.
