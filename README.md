StudyHelper
===========

A program used to aid studying, programmed in C.  I originally programmed the basics in Java, but wanted to convert it to C in order to improve my knowledge of C.  This program is still very much under construction, but the basic premise is complete.

To make/build/compile,

<pre>
make
</pre>

Simple as that.

Compiling prerequisites:
- json-c
- json-c-devel
